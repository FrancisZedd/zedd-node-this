  # You've got to Node-this Project! 🚀

Node-this is the best way to start a project!! This project sets up a basic server structure for a Node.js application, using Express.js and MongoDB. It provides a starting point for building web applications or APIs.

## Project Structure 📁

The project has the following structure:

- 📂 server: Contains the server code and configuration files.
  - 📂 config: Configuration files, including .env and config.js.
  - 📂 controllers: Controllers for handling different routes and requests.
  - 📂 models: Models for defining data structures and interactions with the database.
  - 📂 routes: Route handlers for different endpoints.
  - 📄 server.js: The main entry point of the server application.
- 📄 package.json: Metadata and dependencies for the project.
- 📄 README.md: You're reading it right now!
  
## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kwakuboateng-dev/node-this.git`
2. Run setup to create server folder: `cd your-repo` and run `node setup.js`
3. Install dependencies: `cd server && npm install`
4. Configure the environment variables:
- A `.env` file has already been created in the`server/config` folder.
   - Add the necessary configuration variables to the `.env` file.For example, you might set the `PORT` and 
   `DB_URI` variables.
4. Start the server in development mode: `npm run dev`
5. Access the server at`http://localhost:5000`(or the port you specified).

## Dependencies ⚙️

The project utilizes the following dependencies:

- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. 🚀
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data. 🍃
- Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js. 💎
- body - parser: A middleware for parsing request bodies. 📦
- morgan: A logging middleware for HTTP request / response logging. 🪵
- dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a.env file. 🤫
- nodemon: A tool for automatically restarting the server during development. 🔄
